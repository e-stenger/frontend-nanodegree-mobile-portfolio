## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

2.1 index.html
Optimizations: Resized, optimized, and compressed all images using picresize.com, kraken io, and compressor io. Inlined css. Added async tags to scripts to load last. Removed web font code. Added alt tags to images.
Objective: mobile and desktop scores about 90 - just ran test 4/30 16:10 results 96 desktop 94 mobile.

TO RUN:
Currently can pull site up direct from https://e-stenger.github.io
After project expectations met i will change name back to front-end-mobile-portfolio and you can clone page from github.com/e-stenger and run on your local device.

2.2 views/js/main/js and pizza.html
Optimizations:
Removed determineDX function, Added newWidth variable to changePizzaSizes function, changed width to percent, moved variables outside of for loops whenever possible. Used getElementsByClassName instead of query selector all. Removed unneccessary code.
Objectives: to resize pizzas < 5ms is working. Obtain 60fps while scrolling is also working.

TO RUN:
Currently can pull index.html from http://e-stenger.github.io and click the Cam's Pizzaria link to go right to page.
After project expectations met i will change name back to front-end-mobile-portfolio and you can clone page from github.com/e-stenger and run on your local device.

Further instructions on optimizations and running on a local server are listed below!

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

#### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

#### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
